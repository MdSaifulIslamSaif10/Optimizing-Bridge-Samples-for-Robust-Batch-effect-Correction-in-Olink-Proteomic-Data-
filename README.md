BridgeOpt: Optimizing Bridge Samples for Batch-effect Correction in Olink® Proteomics
Overview

BridgeOpt is a simulation-driven framework designed to evaluate and optimize bridge sample strategies for batch-effect correction in Olink® proteomic data.
This repository provides R scripts to reproduce the analyses, simulation workflows, and Shiny application described in “From Design to Deployment: Optimizing Bridge Samples for Robust Batch-effect Correction in Olink Proteomic Data”. The project systematically compares the Olink bridge-based normalization method with ComBat, explores bridge sample selection strategies, and identifies the optimal number of bridge samples needed for effective normalization under varying study conditions.
